# Find my Favorite Color

1. What is the project?

This project is a web application that lets a user find their favorite color. It cycles through all hex color values, doing a kind of tournament, until one color is remaining.

2. What is the MVP (minimal viable product)?

The application must allow a user to login and save progress to the account.
The user must be allowed to select one color, get two fresh colors, or restart the 'game'.
The user must be able to stay logged in.
When a user logs out, the game will be reset.

3. What are the nice-to-haves?

The application must save a user's progress locally.
The hex values of the colors should be available.

4. When will the project be complete?

When the MVP is complete and the site has been styed, the project will be complete.
